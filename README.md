## Description

Group dining has always been accompanied by one issue: who is going to pay the bill in advance ? Whether the bill is paid separately or voluntarily paid for everyone first, it will still bring up an additional issue: how to split the tax. The payer is also obligated to request back the money from debtors afterwards, which may be awkward as requesting back money does affect one psychologically. Therefore, paying during group dining has always been a hassle. 

This project aims to resolve such inconvenience by developing an improvised food ordering application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap 5, AJAX, JSON, and MySQL Server, that helps with bill calculation and improves daily restaurant operations by providing them with an affordable food ordering platform capable of running on low-end devices.
