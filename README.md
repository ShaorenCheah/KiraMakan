## Description

Group dining has always been accompanied by one issue: who is going to pay the bill in advance ?
Whether the bill is paid separately or voluntarily paid for everyone first, it will still bring up an additional
issue: how to split the tax. Should the tax be divided equally or according to what each person has
ordered ? It is inconvenient to calculate, and sometimes it might even be unfair if the tax is divided equally.
The payer is also obligated to request back the money from debtors afterwards, which may be awkward
as requesting back money does affect one psychologically. Although it is the responsibility of the debtor
to repay, sometimes the payer has to face a scenario where the debtor forgets to repay or even feigns
ignorance. The topic of bills and money is also hard to talk about as it is socially awkward, and it may
create an image of someone being stingy, leading to the issue being forgotten afterwards. Therefore,
paying during group dining has always been a hassle. This project aims to resolve such inconvenience
by developing an improvised food ordering application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap 5,
AJAX, JSON, and MySQL Server, that helps with bill calculation and improves daily restaurant operations
by providing them with an affordable food ordering platform capable of running on low-end devices.
